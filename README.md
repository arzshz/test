# How to use :
# Download the python file from this URL (https://github.com/arzshz/test/tree/master).
# When web services (flask-django-fastapi) are running correctly, by running this test file you can see the response headers of them (which should be the same) and if the html files are the same it prints "Outputs are the same.".
